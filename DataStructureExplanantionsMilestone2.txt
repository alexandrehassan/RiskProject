    Renamed

    Additions

        -GameFrame
        Events:
            -GameOverEvent
            -GameStartEvent
            -OwnerChangeEvent
            -PlayerEliminatedEvent
            -PlayerStateEvent
            -TurnStateEvent

Changes in Map:
    Changed countries and continents to hashmaps
        fast addition and lookup(since the keys are the names of the countries.
    Made the add neighbor add the neighbors both ways (A-B and B-A at once instead of two calls).
    Removed printMap as it isn't used anymore
    loadContinents is not done with an array of names instead of indexes.

Continent:
    now adds an array of countries all at once instead of in multiple calls.

Country:
    *Made the add neighbor add the neighbors both ways (A-B and B-A at once instead of two calls).*
    added hasNeighbor to remove the needs to do country.getNeighbors.contains(A) instead we can
        simply do country.hasNeighbor which ?reduces? the coupling of our classes.
