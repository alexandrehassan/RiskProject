XML:
    Creation of methods to translate a game to XML and to allow the creation of a game from an XML file
        saveGame takes in a gamemodel and creates a save named save.xml this xml file represents everything needed to
            continue the game.
        mapFromXML takes in a file and creates a map that can be played (the game is always created from an xml file)
        loadGame creates a gameModel from a fileName (basically the oposite of savegame)
    We decided to go with static methods for everything in the XML file because it uses less memory and prevents us from having
        create useless objects.
