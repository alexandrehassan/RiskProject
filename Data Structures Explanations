Parser:
    reader : Scanner
        Imported from 'java.util.Scanner.' Allows parser to read the input from the command line,
        which is then modified and transformed into an interpretable command

    commandWords : CommandWords
        Class created for this project. Used to check if the first word entered falls under the
        category of recognized 'command words' and creates a command accordingly

Command:
    commandWord : String
        The 'main' word that must match one of the designated words from CommandWords. It is this
        'main' command word that decides what happens next once the Command is received

CommandWords:
    validCommands : String[]
        An array of strings that contains all recognized command words. Stored as a string so it
        can be checked for equality with other strings, and stored in an array so it can be
        modified and set prior to the program being run
