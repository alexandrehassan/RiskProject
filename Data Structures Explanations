        We used a LinkedList because they are faster at addition and deletion than the Array backed Arraylist. Additionally
        it is only slightly longer to loop over a linkedlist than an arraylist so the methods that look for objects are
        not affected too much. The countries list is mostly used in the creation of the map where there are a lot of additions.

    continents: ArrayList<Continents>
        Because most of the continent operations are gets (better in ArrayLists) continent is an arraylist.

    final string: CONSTANTS
        Instead of creating an object to be stored for each country we decided to use constants to store the Strings representing
        the names of all the countries. This way we can minimise the number of "useless" variables.

Player:
    countries: LinkedList<Country>
        we needed some sort of list in order to be able to hold multiple objects without creating different
        variables for each country of the map.

    name:String
        This one is pretty self explanatory.

    eliminated:boolean
        While we could have removed the player from the list of players when he was eliminated we decided to have an
        eliminated field for 2? reasons.

        1. To make it possible to play multiple games without resetting the players everytime.

        2. When we get a GUI this will make it easier to display stats during the game (such as having the eliminated players
            be greyed out.)


Game:
    players: ArrayList<Players>
        we needed some sort of list in order to be able to hold multiple objects without creating different
        variables for each Player in the game.

        We decided to use an ArrayList here because players will stay the same during the game and would probably not change
        between games. This means that the list is used mostly for accessing the different players which is better with ArrayLists.

    currentPlayer: Player
        We need to have a way of storing which player is playing at the moment. There are multiple ways we could have done this
        (storing the index of the player and storing the player being the most viable)

        We decided to go with storing the player because storing the index of the currentPlayer (the index from players)
        would have meant that every time we wanted to access one of the methods/property of the current player we would
        have need to players.get(index) which would add unneccesary code (using player.whatever() shows what is going on
        in way simpler terms then players.get(index).whatever())

    map : Map
        not affected too much. The countries list is mostly used in the creation of the map where there are a lot of additions.
