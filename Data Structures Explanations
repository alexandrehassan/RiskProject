Parser:
1. Scanner reader
Imported from 'java.util.Scanner.' Allows parser to read the input from the command line,
which is then modified and transformed into an interpretable command
2. CommandWords commandWords
Class created for this project. Used to check if the first word entered falls under the
category of recognized 'command words' and creates a command accordingly

Command:
1. String commandWord
The 'main' word that must match one of the designated words from CommandWords. It is this
'main' command word that decides what happens next once the Command is received
2. String commandDetails
Any additional instructions provided by the user. While the commandWord decides what to do
next, commandDetails offer additional information about what to do next. An example of this
would be when attacking, commandDetails will contain the country being attacked and the
country that is doing the attacking.

CommandWords:
1. String[] validCommands
An array of strings that contains all recognized command words
2. String[] commandMethod
An array of strings that contains the explanations for what to do and what is done for each
command word. For example, the commandMethod for 'attack' tells the user how to write the
command, and the commandMethod for 'end' describes how that command 'ends (the) turn'
