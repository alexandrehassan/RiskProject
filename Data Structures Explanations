Map:
    countries: LinkedList<Country>
        we needed some sort of list in order to be able to hold multiple objects without creating different
        variables for each country of the map.

        We used a LinkedList because they are faster at addition and deletion than the Array backed Arraylist. Additionally
        it is only slightly longer to loop over a linkedlist than an arraylist so the methods that look for objects are
        not affected too much. The countries list is mostly used in the creation of the map where there are a lot of additions.
