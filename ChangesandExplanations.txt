Creation of AIPlayer-
    Extends Player and adds one public method: playturn
    it also overrides all messages that are normally given as pop-ups.

Player:
    Creation of a method getInnerCountries (helps AI with decision making)
    handling of input prompts.

GameController:
    changed the states from ints to a single Enum
    added constants for every command and string we have.

GameFrame:
    added history handling
        Popup with all of the messages from the past turns.
    removed system.outs

GameModel:
    modified in order to accomodate AIPlayer
        mostly methods that take in Country objects instead of Strings.
        changes to nextPlayer so all AIPlayer turns happen automatically
    Moved all input prompts into players. (allows AI to do them in the background)
    handling of end of game now works better



Reset:
    allows the frame, model, and map to be reset all at once allowing for a new game to start.
